    git clone https://github.com/qiuzan2001/PhoneAssistAgent.git 
    cd PhoneAssistAgent

    ```
   
### Twilio setup

#### Point a Phone Number to your ngrok URL
In the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/), go to **Phone Numbers** > **Manage** > **Active Numbers** and click on the additional phone number you purchased for this app in the **Prerequisites**.

In your Phone Number configuration settings, update the first **A call comes in** dropdown to **Webhook**, and paste your ngrok forwarding URL (referenced above), followed by `/incoming-call`. For example, `https://[your-ngrok-subdomain].ngrok.app/incoming-call`. Then, click **Save configuration**.

### Update the .env file

Create a `/env` file, or copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

In the .env file, update the `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key from the **Prerequisites**.

## Run the app
Once ngrok is running, dependencies are installed, Twilio is configured properly, and the `.env` is set up, run the dev server with the following command:
```
python main.py
```
## Test the app
With the development server running, call the phone number you purchased in the **Prerequisites**. After the introduction, you should be able to talk to the AI Assistant. Have fun!

## Special features

### Have the AI speak first
To have the AI voice assistant talk before the user, uncomment the line `# await send_initial_conversation_item(openai_ws)`. The initial greeting is controlled in `async def send_initial_conversation_item(openai_ws)`.

### Interrupt handling/AI preemption
When the user speaks and OpenAI sends `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, the code will clear the Twilio Media Streams buffer and send OpenAI `conversation.item.truncate`.

Depending on your application's needs, you may want to use the [`input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-server-events/input-audio-buffer-speech-stopped) event, instead, or a combination of the two.
